# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction:

-> This project predicts house prices in Bangalore using a Linear Regression model.
-> It uses features such as area (in sqft), number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and location to estimate property prices.
-> The dataset used is bengaluru_house_prices.csv, which contains real estate data from Bangalore.
-> The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, convert categorical data, and remove outliers.
-> A Linear Regression model is trained on the cleaned data to learn the relationship between features and prices.
-> The model's performance is evaluated using R-squared score (~0.75) and Mean Absolute Error (5â€“10% of average house price).
-> After training, the model makes a sample prediction to demonstrate its output.
-> This project shows how machine learning can solve real-world problems like property price estimation.
